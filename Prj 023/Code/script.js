// Project Description :
// Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new
// gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
// Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so
// one average score per team).
// A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team.
// Otherwise, no team wins!
// Your tasks:
// 1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
// 2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
// 3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
// as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner
// to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.
// Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
// 4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and
// Data 2
// 5. Ignore draws this time
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
// ยง Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27

// Project Solution :
// 1. Based on Data 1
const calcAverage = (score1, score2, score3) => (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3;
let dolphinsAverage = calcAverage(44, 23, 71);
let koalasAverage = calcAverage(65, 54, 49);
const checkWinner = function (avgDilphins, avgKoalas) {
  if (avgDilphins > 2 * avgKoalas)
    console.log(`Dolphins Won (${avgDilphins} vs. ${avgKoalas})`);
  else if (avgKoalas > 2 * avgDilphins)
    console.log(`Koalas Won (${avgKoalas} vs. ${avgDilphins})`);
  else console.log(`No Team Won`);
};
checkWinner(dolphinsAverage, koalasAverage);

// 2. Based on Data 2
dolphinsAverage = calcAverage(85, 54, 41);
koalasAverage = calcAverage(23, 34, 27);
checkWinner(dolphinsAverage, koalasAverage);
